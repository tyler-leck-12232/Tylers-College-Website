            <h4>The Moon&nbsp;</h4>
            <h6>I had originally made the moon to be in the SHS fall play of Romeo and Juliet but unfortunately the director of the show Anne Poyner didn't like it. In order to show off the hard work I had done to build it I placed it in the lobby to show off. The moon will be used in future preformaces by SHS such as footloose. The moon can also change color so it can work with the theme of any scene its put in. The moon is comprised of two sheets of wood with leds custom sodered and hotglued to the back then they are wired to decoders which we can then control it from out lighting board. The front of the moon is a hula hoop covered in tape and then screwed together with a sheet of painted plexiglass.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</h6>

            <h4>The Newsies Light Boxes&nbsp;</h4>
            <h6>The newsies light boxes were a very ambitious project. I had started on the boxes almost 4 weeks prior to the show. I used the help of other students in lower grade levels teaching them basic wiring skills in order to hook up all 12 boxes for a total of 48 strands of led tape. After wiring up the boxes we stapled some sheets of semi clear plasic newspaper to the front of them to give them the effect of having a newspaper on it. We then hung them up to the truss that we had built (because we were doing the show outside.) and wired them up to the decoders that were under the stage we then connected them to the lighing board so that we could control them. The light boxes could change to any color that we desire in order to fit the scene. In that show we also had hung 2 50 pound moving lights to a truss in the audence so that we could have lights that could move and change color.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</h6>

            <h4>The Pippin Sign and Stage&nbsp;</h4>
            <h6>The Pippin sign I think was the place where it all started I had built the sign myself with very little help the sign comprises of a sheet of wood cut out to form the letters a piece of plywood cut out to only the outside to form the lip and a small piece of a very thin wood called luon around the edges to hide the leds. We had both incandecent lights to light up in different patterns and led tape around the edgesw so that it could change color. The lights around the stage had to be wired and pre measured and ziptied before hanging. We used four stands of lights together to form one part of the outside/underside ring. This was because we wanted a similar effect to like at a boardwalk sign where the lights look in a pattern where the light is moving in a certain direction I had spent hours measuring the bulbs each 6 in. apart to make sure they were the right distance and so that they were wired correctly. The whole thing took a very long time and we had some of the bulbs not working on opening night. On the second night we were able to get all the lights up and running as you see in the photo above.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</h6>

            <h4>Mama Mia Set and Lights</h4>
            <h6>Mama Mia was the last show that SHS did before the pandemic hit in this set we re-used the lights from pippin and turned them into the festoons that you see in this italian scene. The I helped to hang the lights and constuct the set of this show. We also hung lights underneath the balcony in order to light the actors below. Another thing that we had dont was we also hung one under the plants by the middle door this was if an actor was standing there the audence could more clearly see them. In the show all the tiles that you see were hand painted by students. In the end I was able to take home one of these tiles as a remberance and I still have it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</h6>
